# Optimizing Large Language Models (optim-llm)

This repository contains code and resources for optimizing the performance of large language models (LLMs). The goal of this project is to develop techniques and tools to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs, making them more practical and accessible for a wide range of applications.

## Features

- **Model Compression**: Explore methods for reducing the size and complexity of LLMs without significant loss in performance, such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation.
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Investigate ways to leverage specialized hardware (e.g., GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs) to accelerate the inference and training of LLMs.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Develop strategies for designing effective prompts that can improve the performance of LLMs on specific tasks.
- **Few-shot and Zero-shot Learning**: Explore techniques to enable LLMs to learn and generalize from a small number of examples or even without any labeled data.
- **Efficient Finetuning**: Investigate methods for quickly and efficiently finetuning LLMs for specific tasks and domains.
